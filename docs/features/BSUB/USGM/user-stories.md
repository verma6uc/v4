Description:
The Company Admin accesses the resource monitoring dashboard where the system displays real-time usage metrics across all subscription resources. For each resource type (users, storage, API calls, etc.), the system shows current consumption level, percentage of limit used, and remaining capacity. The system uses visual indicators (progress bars, charts) to represent usage levels, with clear highlighting of resources nearing limits (>80% utilization). The Company Admin can drill down into each resource type to view detailed breakdown of usage by space or application.
