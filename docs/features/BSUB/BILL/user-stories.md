Title: Company Admin manages Payment Methods
Identifier: BSUB.BILL.US1
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Later
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin accesses the payment method section to add, update, or remove payment methods. For credit cards, the system collects card number, expiry date, CVV, and cardholder name, validating each field in real-time. For direct debit, the system collects bank account details and validates them through a micro-deposit verification process. The Company Admin can designate a default payment method and set up backup payment methods. The system masks sensitive payment information and encrypts all payment details. When updating existing payment methods, the system validates the changes and updates any associated recurring payments. The system maintains a history of payment method changes in the audit log.

Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Later
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin configures individuals who should receive billing-related communications. For each billing contact, the system collects name, email, phone, and role (primary/secondary). The Company Admin can specify which notifications each contact should receive (invoices, payment confirmations, payment failures, usage alerts). The system validates email addresses and sends verification emails to new billing contacts. The Company Admin can set notification preferences for each contact (email, in-platform, or both) and configure escalation paths for critical billing issues. The system maintains an audit trail of all changes to billing contacts.

Notes/Questions:

Title: Company Admin configures Billing Notifications
Identifier: BSUB.BILL.US4
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Later
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin sets up rules for billing-related notifications including payment reminders, usage alerts, and invoice availability. For each notification type, the Admin can configure timing (how many days before/after events), recipients (from billing contacts), delivery methods (email/in-platform/both), and escalation rules. The system allows configuration of different notification rules for different billing events (upcoming payments, payment failures, usage thresholds). The Admin can set up custom notification messages and configure notification frequency to prevent alert fatigue. All notification configuration changes are logged for audit purposes.

Title: System processes Failed Payment
Identifier: BSUB.BILL.US5
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Later
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
When a payment attempt fails, the system initiates the configured failure handling process. The system immediately notifies primary billing contacts through configured channels, including failure reason and required actions. The system attempts payment retry based on configured rules (retry intervals, maximum attempts). For each retry attempt, the system logs the outcome and sends appropriate notifications. If maximum retries are exhausted, the system escalates according to configured rules. The system maintains detailed logs of all payment attempts, failures, and notifications for troubleshooting and audit purposes.

Title: System notifies Billing Payment Due
Identifier: BSUB.BILL.US6
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Later
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
When payment due date approaches for any billing event (subscription renewal, usage charges), the system initiates a sequence of notifications to billing contacts. The system sends the first notification 15 days before the due date, including payment amount, due date, configured payment method, and any applicable taxes. At 7 days before due date, the system sends a second notification to all billing contacts. At 2 days before due date, if payment is still pending, the system sends a final reminder with clear payment instructions and potential impact of late payment. Each notification includes a direct link to process the payment and options to view detailed invoice. The system records delivery and open status of each notification in the audit log.
