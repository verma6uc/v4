# Integrations Management (INMT)

## Description
The Integration Management feature enables companies to establish and manage secure connections between the YuVi platform and their external enterprise systems. Currently focused on Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, this feature provides capabilities for companies to leverage their existing identity providers for user authentication and access management.

Through SSO integration, companies can configure their chosen identity provider (such as Azure AD or Okta) to handle user authentication, maintaining security standards while simplifying user access. The feature supports industry-standard protocols like SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect, ensuring compatibility with major identity providers.

The feature manages the complete lifecycle of integrations, from initial setup through ongoing maintenance. This includes handling technical configurations like endpoint URLs and certificates, managing security aspects such as encryption and signature validation, and maintaining role mappings between identity provider groups and YuVi platform roles.

Security is paramount in this feature, with robust validation of all configuration elements, proper certificate management including expiry monitoring, and comprehensive audit logging of all integration-related activities. The feature ensures that integrations remain secure and functional through proper monitoring and timely alerts for any required maintenance actions.

While currently focused on SSO, the feature's architecture is designed to accommodate future integration types that may be needed for enterprise system connectivity, maintaining consistent security and management principles across all integration types.
