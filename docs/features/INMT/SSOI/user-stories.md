## User Story: INMT.SSOI.US1
Title: Company Admin configures SSO Provider
Identifier: INMT.SSOI.US1
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Immediate
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin initiates SSO setup by selecting the authentication protocol (SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect) for connecting YuVi with their organization's identity provider. For automated setup, the Admin provides the Identity Provider Metadata URL, and the system fetches and validates the configuration automatically. For manual setup, the Admin inputs the SSO Endpoint URLs and configures the required service provider settings. The system validates endpoint accessibility, enforces HTTPS requirements, and verifies protocol compliance. Upon successful validation, the system provides YuVi's service provider metadata for the Admin to configure in their identity provider. The system tests the configuration by attempting a test authentication and logs the setup details in the audit trail.

## User Story: INMT.SSOI.US2
Title: Company Admin manages SSO Certificates
Identifier: INMT.SSOI.US2
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Immediate
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin manages the X.509 certificates used for secure SSO communication. During initial setup, the Admin either uploads the identity provider's certificate or the system fetches it from the metadata URL. The system validates the certificate's authenticity, cryptographic strength, and expiration date. For ongoing management, the system monitors certificate validity and alerts the Admin 30 days before expiration. When updating certificates, the system allows upload of new certificates while maintaining the current one until verification is complete. The system blocks SSO logins if certificates expire and logs all certificate management activities in the audit trail.

## User Story: INMT.SSOI.US3
Title: Company Admin maps SSO Roles
Identifier: INMT.SSOI.US3
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Immediate
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin configures how identity provider groups or roles map to YuVi platform roles. The Admin creates mappings between identity provider attributes (like AD groups) and corresponding YuVi roles. The system validates these mappings against company security policies, preventing unauthorized privilege escalation. When conflicts are detected (like mapping to restricted roles), the system alerts the Admin and requires resolution before saving. The system maintains a log of all role mapping changes in the audit trail, including who made the change and when.
