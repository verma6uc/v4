# Company Status Management (COSM)

## Description
This use case handles the lifecycle states of companies on the platform. It enables Super Admins to manage company operational states including suspension and archival. When suspending a company, the system ensures all users are properly restricted from access while maintaining data integrity. Reactivation restores company operations fully. Archival represents a terminal state for companies no longer using the platform, preserving their data for historical purposes while preventing any further activity. The use case includes proper notification mechanisms to inform relevant users about status changes and maintains comprehensive audit trails of all state transitions. It ensures controlled and documented company lifecycle management.
