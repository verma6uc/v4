# Application Deployment User Stories

## Use Case Information
Use Case: Application Deployment
Identifier: SPA.DEP
Uniqueness Check: 1

## User Story: SPA.DEP.US1
Title: SpaceAdmin browses App Store
Identifier: SPA.DEP.US1
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
As a space admin, I browse the App Store page (https://app.example.com/appstore) to view the list of Applications available for deployment. Input: Filter/sorting criteria (e.g., category, status); Output: A list of published Applications with summary details. The system ensures only Applications in the "Published" state are displayed, and filtering and sorting are applied accurately. This enables me to evaluate available Applications for deployment effectively.

## User Story: SPA.DEP.US2
Title: SpaceAdmin deploys Application
Identifier: SPA.DEP.US2
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
As a space admin, I select an Application from the App Store and choose one of the Spaces I administer (https://app.example.com/spaces/{spaceId}/deploy) to deploy the Application. Input: Selection of an Application and a Space (via dropdown or list); Output: A deployment confirmation message and updated Application status. The system ensures deployment is allowed only if I have admin rights in the chosen Space, and the Application's state transitions from "Published" to "Deployed" within that Space.

## User Story: SPA.DEP.US3
Title: SpaceAdmin manages Deployed Application
Identifier: SPA.DEP.US3
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
As a space admin, I access the Space Dashboard page (https://app.example.com/space-admin/spaces/{spaceId}/dashboard) to review and manage Applications deployed in my authorized Space(s). Input: Navigation and selection events (e.g., clicks, filter inputs); Output: A dynamically updated list of deployed Applications showing detailed status, logs, and actionable buttons (e.g., update, remove). The system ensures only Applications deployed in spaces for which I have admin rights are displayed, and any update or removal action triggers an immediate state change and is logged for audit purposes.

## User Story: SPA.DEP.US4
Title: SpaceAdmin updates Deployment Status
Identifier: SPA.DEP.US4
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
As a space admin, I submit structured feedback or configuration changes on a deployed Application via the Space Dashboard (https://app.example.com/spaces/{spaceId}/dashboard). Input: Structured feedback/configuration data (via a form, e.g., text fields, toggles); Output: An updated deployment record with applied changes and log entries. The system ensures changes are applied only if the Application is in a mutable state, validates and records the update, and triggers notifications to relevant stakeholders.
