# Space Type Configuration (STCF)

## Description
This use case enables Company Admins to configure the fields and properties that define a space type. Through this use case, admins can create, modify, and manage fields that capture specific information for spaces of a particular type. Each field can be configured with appropriate data types, validation rules, and display formats. The use case also handles field ordering and deactivation, ensuring that existing spaces maintain data integrity while allowing the space type to evolve over time.
