# Space Creation (SPCR)

## Description
This use case enables Company Admins to create and manage actual spaces within the organization hierarchy based on defined space types. Through this use case, admins can create new spaces by selecting an appropriate space type, providing required information according to the type's field configuration, and placing the space correctly within the hierarchy following established parent-child relationship rules. The use case ensures that all created spaces comply with their type's validation rules and maintain proper hierarchical relationships.
