# Space Type Creation (STMT)

## Description
This use case enables Company Admins to create and manage space type definitions that serve as templates for actual spaces in the organization hierarchy. Space types define the structure and characteristics that spaces of that type will have. Through this use case, admins can create new space types with unique names and descriptions, and modify existing space types while maintaining data integrity for any spaces already using that type.
