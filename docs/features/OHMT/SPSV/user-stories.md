Title: Company Admin views Space List (tabular list view)
Identifier: OHMT.SPSV.US1
Uniqueness Check: 1
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin accesses the space management section where the system displays a paginated list of all spaces. For each space, the system shows key information including space name, space type, parent space, status (active, suspended, archived), and creation date. The list defaults to showing active spaces first, ordered by creation date with most recent spaces at the top. The system indicates the total number of spaces and how many are currently displayed.

## User Story: OHMT.SPSV.US2
Title: Company Admin views Space Details (individual space details)
Identifier: OHMT.SPSV.US2
Uniqueness Check: 1
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin selects a space to view its complete information. The system presents comprehensive details organized by sections: basic information (name, type, status), all configured field values specific to its space type, its position in the hierarchy showing both parent and child spaces, and usage statistics. The system also displays a chronological audit trail of all modifications made to this space. The Company Admin can navigate to related spaces directly from the parent-child relationship section.

## User Story: OHMT.SPSV.US3
Title: Company Admin views Space Hierarchy (organizational chart view)
Identifier: OHMT.SPSV.US3
Uniqueness Check: 1
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin accesses the hierarchy visualization where the system presents an interactive organizational chart of all spaces. The system displays each space as a node, showing its name, type, and status, with connecting lines representing parent-child relationships. The Company Admin can expand or collapse branches of the hierarchy, search for specific spaces within the visualization, and filter the view by space types or status. The system allows zooming and panning for better navigation of large hierarchies.

## User Story: OHMT.SPSV.US4
Title: Company Admin searches Spaces
Identifier: OHMT.SPSV.US4
Uniqueness Check: 1
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin enters search terms into the search field, and the system performs a real-time search across space names, field values, and parent-child relationships. The system dynamically displays matching spaces as the Company Admin types, prioritizing exact matches first followed by partial matches. If multiple search terms are entered, the system finds spaces matching any of the terms and indicates which terms matched. The system maintains the standard space list view format for the search results.

## User Story: OHMT.SPSV.US5
Title: Company Admin filters Space List
Identifier: OHMT.SPSV.US5
Uniqueness Check: 1
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin applies one or multiple filters to the space list, selecting from available filter criteria including space type, status (active, suspended, archived), parent space, and creation date range. The system updates the list in real-time to show only spaces matching all selected filter conditions. The system displays the active filters above the list and shows the count of filtered results, allowing Company Admin to remove individual filters or clear all filters to return to the complete list.

## User Story: OHMT.SPSV.US6
Title: Company Admin applies Advanced Space Filters
Identifier: OHMT.SPSV.US6
Uniqueness Check: 1
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin expands the advanced filtering section to access granular filter criteria. The system allows combining multiple criteria using AND/OR conditions to filter based on specific field values, hierarchy positions, child counts, and other space attributes. The system applies these complex filter rules to the space list, showing only spaces that satisfy the complete filter logic, while displaying a summary of all applied advanced filters for clarity.

## User Story: OHMT.SPSV.US7
Title: Company Admin sorts Space List
Identifier: OHMT.SPSV.US7
Uniqueness Check: 1
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin selects a column header from the space list to sort by that attribute. The system reorders the list based on the selected attribute, toggling between ascending and descending order with each click. When a sort is applied, the system indicates the current sort attribute and direction through a visual indicator on the column header. The Company Admin can add secondary sort criteria by holding the shift key while selecting another column for multi-level sorting capability.

## User Story: OHMT.SPSV.US8
Title: Company Admin exports Space List
Identifier: OHMT.SPSV.US8
Uniqueness Check: 1
Spec Link: LINK

Description:
The Company Admin initiates space list export, and the system prepares a download based on the current view (including any active filters, searches, or sorts). The system generates a formatted file containing space information including all field values, hierarchy information, and status details visible in the current list view. The system notifies the Company Admin when the export is ready and automatically starts the download. For larger exports, the system shows a progress indicator and notifies the Company Admin upon completion.
