# Space Type Hierarchy (STHY)

## Description
This use case enables Company Admins to define and manage the hierarchical relationships between different space types. Through this use case, admins establish rules that determine which space types can be parents or children of other types, creating a coherent organizational structure. The system ensures these hierarchy rules are valid, preventing circular references and maintaining a logical organizational tree. Once validated and published, these rules govern the creation and organization of actual spaces.
