Description:
The Company Admin selects an active space and initiates suspension. The system verifies that suspending this space won't disrupt critical operations. The system ensures all child spaces are either already suspended or will be suspended as part of this operation. Upon confirmation, the system changes the space status to suspended, making it and its child spaces read-only. The system records this suspension in the audit log.
