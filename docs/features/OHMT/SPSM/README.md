# Space State Management (SPSM)

## Description
This use case manages the lifecycle states of spaces within the organization hierarchy. It enables Company Admins to control the availability and usage of spaces through state transitions (active, suspended, archived). The use case handles both individual space state changes and cascading effects on child spaces, ensuring data integrity throughout the hierarchy. It includes a comprehensive notification system to keep users informed of state changes that affect their access to spaces.
