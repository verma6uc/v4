# Product Backlog (PB)

## Description
This use case manages the product backlog functionality within the application creation process. It provides a comprehensive system for organizing and managing application requirements in a hierarchical structure (Feature → Use Case → User Story). The use case ensures proper requirement organization and traceability throughout the application creation lifecycle.

## Implementation in CRT User Stories

- [CRT.US7: System displays Product Backlog](../CRT/user-stories.md#user-story-crtus7)
  * Generates structured product backlog
  * Organizes requirements hierarchically
  * Displays tree-based requirement structure
  * Processes clarification data into backlog items

- [CRT.US11: Creator submits Prototype Feedback](../CRT/user-stories.md#user-story-crtus11)
  * Updates backlog based on prototype feedback
  * Maintains requirement traceability
  * Records structured feedback in backlog context

- [CRT.US9: System displays Application Project Kanban](../CRT/user-stories.md#user-story-crtus9)
  * Translates backlog into project tasks
  * Maintains backlog-to-task relationships
  * Provides dynamic task status updates
