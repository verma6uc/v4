# Reference (REF)

## Description
This use case manages reference data and documentation for applications within the platform. It provides a centralized system for maintaining and accessing application-related reference materials, documentation, and standardized components. The use case ensures that applications are well-documented and follow established reference patterns.

## Implementation in CRT User Stories
The reference functionality is implemented through the following CRT user stories:

- [CRT.US4: System shows Concept Options](../CRT/user-stories.md#user-story-crtus4)
  * Provides reference-based concept generation
  * Uses standardized patterns and templates
  * Presents interpretations based on reference data

- [CRT.US8: Creator reviews Blueprint Diagram](../CRT/user-stories.md#user-story-crtus8)
  * Maps business objects and attributes
  * References standard architectural patterns
  * Provides structured feedback mechanisms

- [CRT.US10: Creator interacts with Application Prototype](../CRT/user-stories.md#user-story-crtus10)
  * Demonstrates reference implementations
  * Shows role-specific views and interactions
  * Provides realistic dummy data examples

## Identifier
- ID: ACRE.REF
- Uniqueness Check: 1

## Notes
- Maintains centralized reference documentation through blueprint diagrams
- Supports standardized component patterns in concept generation
- Enables reference-based application creation through prototypes
- Integrates with application lifecycle documentation through structured feedback
