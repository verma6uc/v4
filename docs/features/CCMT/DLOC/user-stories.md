# Company Default Localization User Stories

## Use Case Information
Use Case: Company Default Localization
Identifier: CCMT.DLOC
Uniqueness Check: 1

## User Story: CCMT.DLOC.US1
Title: Company Admin configured Default Localization
Identifier: CCMT.DLOC.US1
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
The Company Admin establishes standardized regional settings for the platform instance. The Admin configures Default Language (e.g., English, French), Time Zone (e.g., GMT+1, EST), Regional Formats (e.g., date: DD/MM/YYYY, decimal separator: comma), Currency Format and Default Currency (e.g., USD with $ prefix), First Day of Week (e.g., Monday/Sunday), and Measurement Units (metric/imperial). These settings become the default for all new spaces and users in the platform. The system validates inputs to ensure compatibilityâ€”for example, checking that selected time zones exist and that formats align with the chosen language standards. Existing spaces retain their current settings, while new spaces inherit these company defaults. The system logs all changes to default localization settings in the audit trail.

## User Story: CCMT.DLOC.US2
Title: System notifies Space Admins about Localization Changes
Identifier: CCMT.DLOC.US2
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
When company default localization settings change, the system identifies all Space Admins. The system generates a notification informing them about the updated company defaults and that their existing space settings remain unchanged. The system delivers this notification via email and makes it available in the system notification center, allowing Space Admins to review and optionally align their space settings with the new company defaults if desired.
