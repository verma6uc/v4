## User Story: CCMT.CMST.US1
Title: Company Admin configures Company Email Server Settings
Identifier: CCMT.CMST.US1
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
The Company Admin navigates to the communication settings to establish the organization's email infrastructure. They input the SMTP Server Address, Port, and Authentication Credentials, selecting an Encryption Protocol (TLS/SSL) and defining the Sender Identity (display name and email address). The system immediately tests connectivity to the SMTP server, verifying encryption compatibility and authentication validity. If validation fails, the system returns specific error details (e.g., "Invalid credentials" or "Port blocked") and preserves the Admin's inputs for correction. Once validated, the Admin confirms the configuration, prompting the system to apply the settings company-wide and log the changes in the audit trail with timestamps, Admin ID, and modified fields. The Admin receives an in-platform notification confirming successful configuration and an email verification to the new sender address.

## User Story: CCMT.CMST.US2
Title: Company Admin defines System Event Notification Triggers
Identifier: CCMT.CMST.US2
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
The Company Admin reviews the list of system events (e.g., User Invitation, App Deployment Failure) and selects which events should generate notifications. For each trigger, they specify Recipient Groups (roles or spaces), Notification Channels (email/SMS), and Urgency Levels (immediate or batched). The system cross-checks selected triggers against company communication policies, preventing conflicts (e.g., disabling security alerts) and highlighting overrides. When the Admin saves the configuration, the system logs the triggers in the audit trail, including added/removed events and recipient assignments. If critical triggers (e.g., security breaches) are modified, the system sends an email alert to all Company Admins and flags the change in the audit log for review.

## User Story: CCMT.CMST.US3
Title: Company Admin creates Branded Email Templates
Identifier: CCMT.CMST.US3
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
The Company Admin selects a communication type (e.g., User Invitation) and designs a template using placeholders (e.g., {User.Name}) and formatted sections for headers, body, and footers. They upload corporate branding assets (logos, color codes) and position them within the template preview. The system validates that mandatory disclaimers are included and checks for placeholder syntax errors. Upon saving, the system creates a versioned template, logs the Admin's changes in the audit trail, and applies the template to all relevant notifications. If a template omits required branding elements or disclaimers, the system blocks publication and notifies the Admin with guidance to resolve the issue.

## User Story: CCMT.CMST.US4
Title: Company Admin configures Mandatory Communication Disclaimers
Identifier: CCMT.CMST.US4
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Later

Description:
The Company Admin drafts legal text (e.g., confidentiality clauses) in the communication settings, specifying its placement (e.g., email footer). The system automatically appends the disclaimer to all outbound messages, dynamically adjusting formatting based on the communication type. When the Admin edits the disclaimer, the system updates all active templates in the background and logs the change in the audit trail with a comparison of previous and new text. If a template is saved without the disclaimer, the system rejects the action and alerts the Admin via an in-platform banner and email.
