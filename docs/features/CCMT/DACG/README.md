# Company Default Access Governance (DACG)

## Description
The Company Default Access Governance use case enables companies to establish standardized access control policies and documentation requirements across their YuVi platform instance. Through this use case, Company Admins can configure how access changes are reviewed, documented, and approved throughout the organization.

The use case manages the configuration of periodic access reviews, setting standard frequencies and scopes for reviewing user access across the platform. Companies can define when reviews must occur, what aspects of access need review, and how review outcomes should be documented. The system enforces these review cycles and maintains comprehensive records of review completions and decisions.

For access changes, the use case allows companies to set global documentation requirements, determining whether all access modifications need justification or only specific types. Companies can also configure approval workflows, choosing between global approval requirements or specific scenarios needing approval. When enabled, these requirements ensure proper governance of all access changes through consistent documentation and approval processes.

The use case supports both streamlined and rigorous governance approaches, allowing companies to balance security needs with operational efficiency. All access governance configurations are properly tracked in the audit log, maintaining clear records of policy changes and enforcement. The system ensures that once configured, these governance requirements are consistently applied across all access management activities in the platform.
