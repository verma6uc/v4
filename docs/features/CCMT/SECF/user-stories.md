# Account Security Configuration User Stories

## Use Case Information
Use Case: Account Security Configuration
Identifier: CCMT.SECF
Uniqueness Check: 1

## User Story: CCMT.SECF.US1
Title: Company Admin configures Invitation Settings
Identifier: CCMT.SECF.US1
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
The Company Admin accesses the account security settings to configure user invitation parameters. The Admin sets the invitation link validity period (how long invitations remain active before expiring). The Admin configures the maximum number of times an invitation can be resent for the same user account. The system validates that the validity period meets minimum security requirements (not too long) while ensuring practical usability (not too short). Upon validation, the system applies these invitation settings company-wide, affecting all future invitations. The system maintains existing invitations with their original configuration and logs these setting changes in the audit trail.

Notes:
This will require us to define some platform rules to define the constraints so that the company admin is not able to configure the parameters such that the security is weak.

## User Story: CCMT.SECF.US2
Title: Company Admin updates Password Policy
Identifier: CCMT.SECF.US2

Notes:
This will require us to define some platform rules to define the constraints so that the company admin is not able to configure the parameters such that the security is weak.

## User Story: CCMT.SECF.US4
Title: Company Admin configures Session Lock Rules
Identifier: CCMT.SECF.US4
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
The Company Admin sets the inactivity period after which the system locks the application. The system allows configuration of the lock timeout duration, ensuring it meets minimum security standards. Upon reaching the inactivity threshold, the system preserves the user's work state but requires password re-entry to resume activity. Upon confirmation, the system applies these lock rules to all user sessions.

Notes:
This will require us to define some platform rules to define the constraints so that the company admin is not able to configure the parameters such that the security is weak.
