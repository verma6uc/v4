## User Story: USPM.UAMG.US1
Title: Admin updates User Basic Information
Identifier: USPM.UAMG.US1
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Immediate

Description:
The Admin accesses a user's profile to update fundamental information including full name (first, middle, last), designation, and space. The system validates name formatting rules and checks designation against the company's approved list. For designation changes, the system enforces approval workflows if configured and captures change justification. The system validates department selection based on the company's organizational structure. Upon changes to designation, the system triggers role suggestion reevaluation to ensure proper application access. The system maintains a complete history of these changes, including previous values, change context, and timestamps. For name changes, the system updates all dependent systems including display names in applications, email systems, and directory services. The system ensures updates propagate across the platform while maintaining historical references in audit logs and existing records. The change process includes validation of Admin's scope - ensuring Company Admins can modify all fields while Space Admins have limited modification rights. The system generates appropriate notifications based on the significance of changes, with designation changes triggering higher-priority notifications.

## User Story: USPM.UAMG.US2
Title: Admin manages User Email
Identifier: USPM.UAMG.US2
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Immediate

Description:
The Admin initiates email address modification through the user management interface. The system performs comprehensive validation: email format checking, domain verification against allowlists, and duplicate email detection across active, suspended, and archived accounts. For company email domain changes, the system validates against approved company domains. The change process implements a secure verification workflow - sending verification links to both old and new email addresses with configurable expiration periods. The system maintains the old email as active until verification completes successfully. During the verification period, the system shows clear status indicators in user management interfaces. Upon successful verification, the system coordinates updates across all platform components: authentication systems, notification preferences, integration endpoints, and directory services. The system handles failed verifications gracefully, providing clear error messages and resolution paths. For bulk company email domain migrations, the system provides specialized handling with staged verification processes. The system maintains detailed logs of the entire email change process, including all verification attempts and final status.

## User Story: USPM.UAMG.US3
Title: Admin manages User Profile Picture
Identifier: USPM.UAMG.US3
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Later

Description:
The Admin handles profile picture management through a dedicated interface supporting both individual uploads and bulk operations. The system enforces strict image validation: format checks (JPEG, PNG), size limits, dimension requirements, and content appropriateness screening. Upon upload, the system automatically processes images: creating multiple resolutions for different use cases (thumbnails, full size, high-DPI displays), optimizing file sizes, and storing them securely. The system maintains aspect ratios while allowing Admin-controlled cropping. For removing profile pictures, the system generates default avatars based on user names with consistent styling. The system supports company-wide profile picture policies: enforcing minimum quality standards, maintaining consistent background styles, or requiring specific formats. For bulk operations, the system provides efficient processing with progress tracking and error handling. The system maintains a history of profile picture changes for audit purposes while implementing efficient storage management for previous versions. The interface provides immediate preview capabilities showing how pictures will appear across different platform contexts.

Notes:
For now we will only have name initials as the avatar. For example Mustaq Singh's avatar becomes MS.

## User Story: USPM.UAMG.US4
Title: Admin resets User Password
Identifier: USPM.UAMG.US4
Uniqueness Check: 1
Phase: Immediate

Description:
The Admin initiates password reset through the user management interface, optionally providing a reset reason. The system immediately invalidates the current password while maintaining session status based on configuration (immediate logout vs. next login requirement). The system generates a secure, time-limited reset link following platform security standards. For the reset notification, the system sends a secure email containing the reset link, clear instructions, expiration information, and security advisories. The system enforces company-configured password reset policies: expiration times, allowed reset frequencies, and required approvals for sensitive accounts. The system handles failed reset attempts gracefully, providing clear error messages and alternative reset paths. For bulk resets, the system implements rate limiting and staged processing to prevent system overload. The system maintains comprehensive audit logs of all reset activities, including request context, delivery status, and completion status. The interface provides clear status tracking of pending resets with the ability to revoke unprocessed reset links.

Description:
The Admin configures user-specific regional settings through a dedicated interface. The system provides comprehensive regional configuration options: language preference, time zone, date/time format, number format, and currency display. The interface shows live previews of how these settings affect different aspects of the platform. The system validates combinations of settings for consistency and handles conflicts intelligently (e.g., currency format vs region-specific requirements). For language settings, the system manages fallback preferences for partially translated content. The system coordinates these preferences across all platform components and integrated applications. For bulk updates, the system provides efficient tools for setting regional preferences based on organizational structure or location. The system maintains change history and allows scheduled updates for preferences that need coordination with business hours or system maintenance.
