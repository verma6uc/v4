Title: System generates Role Suggestions on User Creation
Identifier: USPM.SARA.US1
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
When a user account is created and assigned a designation, the system automatically initiates the role suggestion process. The system first identifies all applications deployed in the spaces the user is assigned to. For each identified application, the system analyzes the user's designation to determine appropriate role suggestions based on built-in patterns and previous assignments within the company. The system considers multiple factors when generating suggestions: the user's designation, their space assignments, application usage patterns within those spaces, and common role patterns for similar designations across the company. For each suggested role, the system records the basis of the suggestion (designation match, space context, or pattern match) to provide clear justification. When generating suggestions, the system enforces role dependency rules within each application, ensuring all prerequisite roles are included in suggestions. The system prioritizes suggestions based on confidence levels, marking highly confident suggestions (exact designation matches) versus pattern-based suggestions that may need more review. The system associates these suggestions with the user's pending account activation, ensuring they are ready for review when the account becomes active. The system notifies relevant administrators based on the spaces and applications involved. These notifications include context about the new user, their designation, and the number of role suggestions pending review. All generated suggestions are recorded with their justification basis, timestamp, and triggering event (user creation in this case), maintaining a clear audit trail of how and why each suggestion was generated.

Title: System generates Role Suggestions on Designation Change
Identifier: USPM.SARA.US2
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
When a user's designation is changed, the system automatically initiates a comprehensive role suggestion reevaluation process. The system first persists the user's current application role assignments as reference data. It then identifies all applications deployed in the spaces where the user has access, including both applications where they currently have roles and those they don't. For each identified application, the system analyzes the user's new designation to determine appropriate role suggestions. The system compares these new suggestions against the user's current role assignments, categorizing them into three groups: roles to remain unchanged, roles to be potentially removed (no longer aligned with new designation), and new roles to be potentially added (aligned with new designation). The system applies different confidence levels to its suggestions. For role removals, it considers the historical usage patterns of those roles by the user before suggesting removal. For new role suggestions, it considers how strongly they align with the new designation based on company patterns. The system flags any critical role changes that might impact ongoing operations or user's active work in applications. For roles suggested for removal, the system performs impact analysis checking for: pending approvals or workflows where user is involved, data ownership implications, and delegation requirements. These insights are included with the suggestions to help administrators make informed decisions. The system notifies relevant administrators about pending suggestion review, with priority indicators based on: the scale of suggested changes, impact analysis results, and criticality of affected applications. The notification includes comparison of current versus suggested role assignments and the reasoning behind each suggested change. All generated suggestions maintain reference to the designation change event, including both old and new designations, timestamp, and the admin who initiated the designation change. The system preserves this context throughout the suggestion lifecycle until they are either applied or dismissed.

## User Story: USPM.SARA.US3
Title: System generates Role Suggestions on Application Deployment
Identifier: USPM.SARA.US3
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
When an application is deployed to a space, the system automatically initiates role suggestion generation for all users who have access to that space. The system first identifies all users associated with the space, including those with access through parent spaces in the hierarchy. For each identified user, the system analyzes their designation to determine appropriate role suggestions in the newly deployed application. The system processes these suggestions in space hierarchy order, starting from the space where the application is directly deployed and then moving up the hierarchy to parent spaces, ensuring proper inheritance of access patterns. For each suggested role, the system records whether it's based on direct space access or inherited space access, as this affects the suggestion confidence level. For applications that are being redeployed (new versions), the system includes the previous role assignments as reference data. It compares the application's current roles against the previous version's roles, identifying any new roles added or existing roles modified. For unchanged roles, it maintains the historical assignment patterns. For new or modified roles, it generates fresh suggestions based on current designation patterns. The system assigns different priority levels to suggestions based on: user's designation match strength, space access type (direct vs inherited), and for redeployments, any previous role assignments. Critical role suggestions, particularly those needed for application administration or essential workflows, are flagged for immediate attention. The system generates notifications in a hierarchical manner following the space structure. Space admins receive suggestions for their direct space users, while parent space admins receive consolidated notifications about suggestion patterns across their space hierarchy. Each notification includes deployment context, affected user counts by designation, and suggestion priority indicators. All generated suggestions maintain reference to the deployment event, including application version, deployment space, timestamp, and deploying admin. The system preserves this deployment context throughout the suggestion lifecycle, linking all related suggestions to enable batch processing if needed.

## User Story: USPM.SARA.US4
Title: System generates Role Suggestions on Space Assignment Change
Identifier: USPM.SARA.US4
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
When a user's space assignment changes (either addition or removal of space access), the system automatically initiates role suggestion generation for all applications deployed in the affected spaces. For space addition, the system identifies all applications deployed in the newly assigned space and any applications inherited from parent spaces in the hierarchy. For space removal, the system identifies all applications that will no longer be accessible due to the space access removal. In case of space addition, for each application identified, the system analyzes the user's designation to generate appropriate role suggestions. The suggestions consider both the user's designation and their previous role patterns in similar applications across other spaces they have access to. The system flags any suggestions that align with existing role assignments in other spaces, as these represent consistent access patterns. For space removal scenarios, rather than immediately generating removal suggestions, the system first performs an impact analysis. It identifies any active tasks, pending approvals, or owned data in the applications that would be affected by role removal. The system generates a comprehensive impact report that accompanies the removal suggestions, helping administrators understand the implications of role changes. The system handles cascading space changes appropriately. When a user is assigned to a child space but already has access through a parent space, the system analyzes whether more specific role assignments are needed at the child space level. Similarly, when direct space access is removed but parent space access remains, the system evaluates which role assignments should be preserved through inheritance. All generated suggestions include clear context about the space change event, affected applications, and the basis for each suggestion. The system maintains this context throughout the suggestion lifecycle, enabling administrators to understand the full impact of the space change on role assignments. The system also tracks any role assignments that would be automatically removed due to space access loss, distinguishing these from suggestions that require admin review. The system notifies relevant space administrators about pending suggestion reviews, with the notifications organized by space hierarchy. Each notification includes the space change context, number of affected applications, and any critical impacts identified during analysis.

Title: Admin views Role Suggestions Dashboard
Identifier: USPM.SARA.US5
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
The Admin accesses the role suggestions dashboard which serves as the central hub for managing all role suggestions across their scope of access. The system presents a comprehensive overview showing pending suggestions organized by different contexts: by user (grouped by designation), by application (grouped by space), by space (following the hierarchy), and by generation trigger (user creation, designation change, space change, application deployment). The dashboard shows key metrics prominently: total pending suggestions, suggestions requiring immediate attention (based on critical applications or impact analysis), suggestions grouped by confidence levels, and aging suggestions that have been pending review for extended periods. For each metric, the system provides one-click access to the relevant filtered view of suggestions. The system allows flexible organization of the suggestion view through dynamic filtering and sorting. Admins can filter suggestions based on generation date, trigger type, affected users, applications, spaces, confidence levels, and impact severity. The filtered view updates in real-time, maintaining all context and grouping options. The system preserves the Admin's last used filters and view preferences within their session. For each suggestion group, the system displays summary information including the number of suggested roles, any role removals pending, impact indicators, and the suggestion generation context. The Admin can expand any group to see detailed suggestions, with the system showing clear justification for each suggested role including designation matches and historical patterns. The expanded view also shows any dependencies between suggestions, highlighting where changes need to be applied together. The system enables bulk actions directly from the dashboard, allowing the Admin to select multiple suggestions for review, modification, or application. When bulk selecting suggestions, the system shows a smart summary of common patterns and differences across the selection, helping the Admin make informed decisions about batch processing. All actions taken from the dashboard, including view changes, filters applied, and suggestions accessed, are tracked for audit purposes. The system maintains the Admin's context as they navigate between different views and suggestion details, allowing efficient processing of multiple suggestions while maintaining awareness of overall suggestion status.

Title: Admin reviews Role Suggestions from User Profile
Identifier: USPM.SARA.US6
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
When reviewing role suggestions from a user's profile, the system presents a dedicated section showing all pending role suggestions for that specific user. The system organizes suggestions by applications within the user's accessible spaces, clearly indicating whether they are new role suggestions or modification suggestions for existing roles. Each suggestion displays its generation trigger (designation change, space change, etc.) and generation date for context. The system shows the user's current designation prominently, along with their space assignments, as this forms the basis for many suggestions. For each application with pending suggestions, the system presents a comparative view showing current role assignments (if any) alongside suggested roles. The system visually distinguishes between roles suggested for assignment and roles suggested for removal, with clear indicators of the suggestion's confidence level and reasoning. When the Admin expands an application's suggestions, the system shows detailed justification for each suggestion including designation patterns, similar user patterns, and any relevant historical data. For role removal suggestions, the system prominently displays impact analysis results, showing any active tasks, pending approvals, or owned data that would be affected. The system also highlights any role dependencies or conflicts that need consideration. The Admin can review suggestions in any order, with the ability to accept, modify, or dismiss individual suggestions while maintaining others for later review. When modifying suggestions, the system provides real-time validation feedback about role combinations and dependencies. The system maintains the complete suggestion context throughout the review process, preserving the original suggestion reasoning and any Admin modifications. As suggestions are reviewed, the system updates the user's suggestion status in real-time, reflecting decisions made by the Admin. The system maintains an audit trail of the review process, including which suggestions were viewed, decisions made, and any modifications applied. Each review action is timestamped and linked to both the original suggestion and the reviewing Admin.

## User Story: USPM.SARA.US7
Title: Admin reviews Role Suggestions during Application Deployment
Identifier: USPM.SARA.US7
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
During application deployment process, after the Admin selects the target space for deployment, the system presents a dedicated section showing role suggestions for all affected users. The system first identifies users with access to the target space and its child spaces, then groups suggestions by user designations to show role assignment patterns. For redeployments, the system includes a migration view comparing existing role assignments with new suggestions. The system organizes the suggestions in a hierarchical manner following the space structure. For each space level, it shows affected users grouped by designation, with clear indicators for direct space access versus inherited access. The system displays suggestion confidence levels differently based on designation matches, with strong matches (exact designation patterns) highlighted separately from partial matches that need closer review. For each designation group, the system shows the suggested roles along with the basis for these suggestions. When the Admin expands a group, they see individual users and their specific suggested roles, with any variations from the designation pattern clearly marked. For redeployments, the system highlights roles that are new or modified in this version, distinguishing them from roles that remain unchanged from the previous version. The Admin can review and modify suggestions at both group and individual levels. When making changes at the designation group level, the system allows exceptions for specific users while maintaining group changes for others. The system validates all modifications against the application's role dependencies and security policies, providing immediate feedback about invalid combinations. All review decisions are captured with deployment context, maintaining traceability between deployment, suggestion generation, and review decisions. The system prevents deployment completion until all role suggestions have been either accepted, modified, or explicitly declined, ensuring conscious access management decisions.

## User Story: USPM.SARA.US8
Title: Admin modifies Role Suggestions before applying
Identifier: USPM.SARA.US8
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
The Admin can modify role suggestions before applying them, regardless of the entry point (dashboard, user profile, or deployment). When initiating modification, the system presents an interface showing the original suggestions alongside the modification area. For each suggestion selected for modification, the system displays the original reasoning and confidence level to provide context for the changes. The system allows modifications at different levels: individual role suggestions, grouped suggestions for similar users, or bulk modifications across multiple applications. When the Admin modifies a suggestion, the system preserves the original suggestion details while capturing the modifications separately. For each modification, the system requires the Admin to provide a reason that explains the deviation from the original suggestion. During modification, the system provides real-time validation of role combinations, highlighting any conflicts or missing dependencies. When the Admin adds roles beyond the original suggestions, the system checks for role conflicts and security policy compliance. For role removals from original suggestions, the system shows impact analysis including affected workflows or data access implications. The system maintains modification context differently based on suggestion types. For new role suggestions, modifications focus on adding or removing roles from the suggested set. For existing role modifications, the system shows current roles, suggested changes, and allows the Admin to fine-tune the final role set. When modifying grouped suggestions, the system allows creating exceptions for specific users while maintaining common modifications for others. All modifications are tracked separately from the original suggestions, creating a clear audit trail of changes made during the review process. The system maintains this modification history through the final application of suggestions, enabling full traceability of decision-making. Modified suggestions are visually distinguished in all views until they are either applied or reset to their original state.

## User Story: USPM.SARA.US9
Title: Admin applies Role Suggestions
Identifier: USPM.SARA.US9
Uniqueness Check: 1

Description:
When the Admin initiates application of role suggestions, the system processes these applications based on their context and scope. For individual user suggestions, the system shows all pending suggestions across applications with their current states (original, modified, or accepted). For bulk application, the system groups suggestions by application and space context, showing summary counts of changes to be applied. Before applying suggestions, the system performs comprehensive validation. It checks current role assignments versus suggested changes, validates all role dependencies and combinations, and verifies the suggestions still align with current user contexts (designation and space assignments might have changed since suggestion generation). The system also performs fresh impact analysis for any role removals to ensure no critical access disruptions. The Admin must provide an application reason that is captured at the appropriate level - single reason for bulk applications or specific reasons for individual cases. For modified suggestions, the system requires the Admin to explicitly acknowledge the deviations from original suggestions, ensuring conscious decision-making for non-standard assignments. When applying suggestions, the system processes them in a specific order: role removals first, followed by new role assignments, ensuring proper handling of role dependencies. The system maintains detailed logs of each role change, linking them to the original suggestions and capturing full context including original suggestion basis, any modifications, and final application decisions. The system generates appropriate notifications based on the applied changes. Affected users receive consolidated notifications about their role changes across applications. Space admins receive summaries of role changes in their spaces. For critical role changes, the system generates priority notifications with immediate delivery. If any suggestions fail during application, the system provides detailed failure reasons while successfully processing other suggestions, maintaining transactional integrity.
