# Comprehensive Process for Building an Application

This document details the complete, end-to-end process for building an Application on our platform. It covers every phase—from the initial idea capture through an AI-driven conversation to final deployment—detailing the roles, inputs/outputs, state transitions, business rules, integration points, and audit logging at each step.

# Six Phases of Building an Application

Below is a concise overview of the six distinct phases involved in building an Application on our platform:

1. **Initiation & Idea Capture (Memory Phase)**
   - **Description:** The process begins with an AI-driven conversation where the Creator interacts with our system to define the Application. Through natural dialogue, the system collects essential inputs such as the Application's title and detailed description.
   - **Output:** A memory document is created, capturing the initial concept and setting the Application state to `MEMORY`.
   - **Key Actions:** Natural language interaction with real-time processing and feedback.

2. **Concept Option Selection & Clarification**
   - **Description:** The system generates multiple concept option cards based on the initial input. The Creator reviews these options and selects one. Following selection, the system presents a series of multiple-choice clarification questions to refine the application's intent.
   - **Output:** Aggregated clarification data that forms the basis for generating a structured Product Backlog.
   - **Key Actions:** Concept selection and answering clarification questions.

3. **Blueprint Creation**
   - **Description:** The refined requirements are used to create a technical Blueprint—a state machine diagram that maps out the Application's architecture, including key business objects, attributes, and actions.
   - **Output:** A Blueprint document with versioning and review status, which is then reviewed and locked after feedback.
   - **Key Actions:** Technical design documentation, feedback collection, and final approval.

4. **Visual PRD Prototyping**
   - **Description:** The approved Blueprint is transformed into a high-fidelity, interactive prototype (Visual PRD) that simulates the final user interface and experience. This phase includes role-specific views using a role dropdown.
   - **Output:** An interactive prototype that reflects the Application's final look and functionality, updated dynamically based on user feedback.
   - **Key Actions:** Prototype interaction and structured feedback submission.

5. **Development & Testing**
   - **Description:** A detailed Project Plan is generated from the Product Backlog and Blueprint. The Application enters the development phase where code is implemented, followed by a rigorous testing phase where unit tests, bug fixes, and performance checks are conducted.
   - **Output:** A fully developed Application in the `UNDER_TESTED` state with documented test results and performance metrics.
   - **Key Actions:** Code development, module integration, and testing.

6. **Deployment & Post-Deployment**
   - **Description:** Once the Application passes all tests and meets quality standards, it transitions to the `DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETE` state. The Creator then reviews and publishes the Application to the company App Store. Other roles (e.g., Company Admins, SpaceAdmins) are responsible for deploying the Application into designated Spaces.
   - **Output:** The Application is published and available for deployment, with its status updated to `PUBLISHED`.
   - **Key Actions:** Final review, publishing action, and deployment into production spaces.
