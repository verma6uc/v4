# Six Phases of Building an Application

Below is a concise overview of the six distinct phases involved in building an Application on our platform:

1. **Initiation & Idea Capture (Memory Phase)**
   - **Description:** The process begins when the Creator clicks the "Create Application" button. The system collects essential inputs such as the Application's title, detailed description, and basic configuration parameters.
   - **Output:** A memory document is created, capturing the initial concept and setting the Application state to `MEMORY`.
   - **Key Actions:** Data input with real-time validation and display of a processing animation.

2. **Concept Option Selection & Clarification**
   - **Description:** The system generates multiple concept option cards based on the initial input. The Creator reviews these options and selects one. Following selection, the system presents a series of multiple-choice clarification questions to refine the application's intent.
   - **Output:** Aggregated clarification data that forms the basis for generating a structured Product Backlog.
   - **Key Actions:** Concept selection and answering clarification questions.

3. **Blueprint Creation**
   - **Description:** The refined requirements are used to create a technical Blueprint—a state machine diagram that maps out the Application's architecture, including key business objects, attributes, and actions.
   - **Output:** A Blueprint document with versioning and review status, which is then reviewed and locked after feedback.
   - **Key Actions:** Technical design documentation, feedback collection, and final approval.

4. **Visual PRD Prototyping**
   - **Description:** The approved Blueprint is transformed into a high-fidelity, interactive prototype (Visual PRD) that simulates the final user interface and experience. This phase includes role-specific views using a role dropdown.
   - **Output:** An interactive prototype that reflects the Application's final look and functionality, updated dynamically based on user feedback.
   - **Key Actions:** Prototype interaction and structured feedback submission.

5. **Development & Testing**
   - **Description:** A detailed Project Plan is generated from the Product Backlog and Blueprint. The Application enters the development phase where code is implemented, followed by a rigorous testing phase where unit tests, bug fixes, and performance checks are conducted.
   - **Output:** A fully developed Application in the `UNDER_TESTED` state with documented test results and performance metrics.
   - **Key Actions:** Code development, module integration, and testing.

6. **Deployment & Post-Deployment**
   - **Description:** Once the Application passes all tests and meets quality standards, it transitions to the `DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETE` state. The Creator then reviews and publishes the Application to the company App Store. Other roles (e.g., Company Admins, SpaceAdmins) are responsible for deploying the Application into designated Spaces.
   - **Output:** The Application is published and available for deployment, with its status updated to `PUBLISHED`.
   - **Key Actions:** Final review, publishing action, and deployment into production spaces.


# Phase 1: Initiation & Idea Capture (Memory Phase)

## Overview
Phase 1 marks the beginning of the Application creation process. In this phase, a Creator initiates a new Application by providing the initial details such as the title, description, and basic configuration parameters. The system captures these inputs, validates them in real time, and then creates a provisional "memory" document that serves as the foundation for all subsequent phases. This phase is critical as it sets the tone for the application's overall vision and guides later stages like concept refinement, blueprint creation, and development.

## Process Flow

### 1. Initiation
- **User Action:**  
  - The Creator clicks the "Create Application" button on the Dashboard page.
  - **URL Example:** `https://app.example.com/creator/applications`
- **System Response:**  
  - The system verifies the user's authentication and initiates a new session.
  - The Creator is redirected to the New Application page.
  - **State Transition:**  
    - From "Dashboard" state to the "New Application" state.

### 2. Data Input: Capturing Basic Application Details
- **Page Context:**  
  - The New Application page is where the Creator enters the core details.
  - **URL Example:** `https://app.example.com/creator/applications/new`
- **Fields & Input Formats:**
  - **Title:**  
    - *Type:* Single-line text field  
    - *Validation:* Must be 3–100 characters; must be unique.
    - *Example:* `"Customer Relationship Manager"`
  - **Description:**  
    - *Type:* Multi-line text area  
    - *Validation:* Up to 2000 characters.
    - *Example:* `"A CRM solution designed to enhance customer engagement and streamline sales processes."`
  - **Configuration Parameters:**

    - As the Creator types, the system validates the data (e.g., ensuring the title is unique and the description does not exceed the character limit).
  - **Contextual Tooltips:**  
    - Provide guidance on what is expected in each field.
  - **Accessibility:**  
    - The form design follows accessibility standards to ensure a smooth input process.

### 3. Processing Animation
- **Trigger:**  
  - After the Creator submits the details by clicking the submission button.
- **Visual Feedback:**  
  - The system displays an AI-induced animated GIF on the same New Application page.
  - **Duration:** Approximately 2–5 seconds.
- **Purpose:**  
  - To indicate that the system is processing the input data.
- **Output:**  
  - The animation confirms that the data is being handled and no duplicate submission occurs.

### 4. Creation of the Memory Document
- **System Operation:**  
  - Once the processing animation completes, the system creates a "memory" subobject linked to the Application.
- **Memory Object Attributes:**
  - **id:** UUID for the memory document.
  - **summary:** A brief summary that encapsulates the initial concept.
  - **createdAt:** Timestamp of creation.
  - **createdBy:** Identifier of the Creator.
  - **notes:** Array of notes or initial requirements captured during the ideation.
- **Output Example:**  
  ```json
  {
    "id": "m123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614178901",
    "summary": "Initial concept capturing key CRM features.",

    "createdBy": "u123e4567",
    "notes": ["Integrate marketing tools", "Focus on intuitive interface"]
  }


# Phase 2: Concept Option Selection & Clarification

## Overview
Phase 2 builds on the initial ideas captured in Phase 1 (Memory Phase). In this phase, the system refines the initial input by generating multiple conceptual interpretations, which are presented as Concept Option cards. The Creator then selects the preferred option, and the system proceeds to ask a series of clarification questions (via a structured Questionnaire) to further detail the application’s requirements. This phase sets the foundation for generating a structured Product Backlog.

## Process Flow

### 1. Concept Option Generation
- **Trigger:**  
  After the Creator’s initial inputs are processed in Phase 1, the system automatically generates multiple (typically three) Concept Option cards.

  - A role dropdown is provided in the upper right corner, allowing the Creator to switch perspectives (e.g., viewing as a regular user or admin).
- **UI Features:**  
  - Responsive elements (buttons, dropdowns, forms) that mimic real interactions.
  - Interactive navigation allowing the Creator to explore different pages and functionalities.
  
### 3. User Interaction and Feedback
- **User Action:**  
  - The Creator reviews and interacts with the prototype, exploring all pages and components.
  - The Creator provides structured feedback on any part of the prototype using a three-part feedback form:
    1. **User Intent Understanding:** Describes what the system should understand about a feature or design element.
    2. **Actions to be Taken:** Specifies modifications or improvements required.
    3. **Effect on Other Assets:** Outlines how the changes will affect related components (e.g., Product Backlog, Blueprint).
- **Input:**  
  - Feedback is submitted via text fields and selection controls in the feedback form.
- **Output:**  
  - The feedback is captured and stored, triggering real-time updates to the prototype if applicable.
- **Page Context:**  
  Feedback is provided directly on the Prototype Preview page (`https://app.example.com/creator/applications/new/prototype`).

### 4. Finalization and State Transition
- **Final Review:**  
  After multiple feedback sessions and iterations, the Creator reviews the updated prototype.
- **Locking the Prototype:**  
  Once satisfied, the Creator locks the Visual PRD, indicating that no further changes are required.
- **State Transition:**  
  The Application’s status transitions from `VISUAL_PRD` to the next phase (e.g., `DURING_DEVELOPMENT`).
- **Audit Logging:**  
  - An audit log entry is created, for example:  
    `"Visual PRD for Application [title] finalized by [creator]."`

- **Notification:**  
  - Regular status updates and alerts if performance deviates from acceptable thresholds.

## Input / Output Data Formats

### Input Data
- **Final Review Confirmation:**  
  - Submitted as a button click or form submission (JSON payload with confirmation flag).
- **Deployment Selection:**  
  - A selection event from dropdowns or lists (JSON with Application ID and Space ID).
- **Feedback & Monitoring Data:**  
  - Real-time performance metrics and feedback entries in JSON format.

### Output Data
- **State Changes:**  
  - API responses updating the Application status (e.g., `"status": "PUBLISHED"`).
- **UI Displays:**  
  - The company App Store renders a list of Applications in a structured table or grid.
  - The Space Deployment page shows confirmation messages and updated deployment statuses.
- **Audit Logs:**  
  - Structured log entries with timestamps, user identifiers, and action descriptions.

## Business Rules & Validation

### Publishing Rules
- **Eligibility:**  
  - Only Applications that have passed all testing criteria and are marked as `UNDER_TESTED` or `DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETE` can transition to `PUBLISHED`.
- **Validation:**  
  - Final review must confirm that all mandatory quality and functional requirements are met.
- **Notifications:**  
  - Successful publishing triggers notifications to the Creator and relevant stakeholders.

### Deployment Rules
- **Access Control:**  
  - Only Company Admins or SpaceAdmins can deploy Applications into a Space.
- **State Enforcement:**  
  - The system only allows deployment of Applications with a `PUBLISHED` status.
- **Audit:**  
  - Each deployment action is recorded with precise audit log messages.

### Monitoring Rules
- **Performance Criteria:**  
  - The Application must meet predefined performance metrics (e.g., response time, uptime) to remain in production.
- **Feedback Requirement:**  
  - Critical feedback from post-deployment monitoring must be reviewed and acted upon if performance thresholds are not met.

## Integration Points

1. **Version Control System:**  
   - Tracks code changes and supports continuous integration during development.
2. **Testing System:**  
   - Manages test execution and ensures that quality metrics are met before deployment.
3. **Deployment System:**  
   - Interfaces with Spaces and the App Store for application deployment.
4. **Monitoring Tools:**  
   - Collect and display real-time performance metrics and user feedback.
5. **Audit Logging System:**  
   - Records all state transitions, publishing, and deployment actions.

## Audit Logging & Notifications

### Audit Logging
- **Publishing:**  
  - `"Application [title] published by [creator] on [timestamp]."`
- **Deployment:**  
  - `"Application [title] deployed to Space [spaceId] by [spaceAdmin] on [timestamp]."`
- **State Transitions:**  
  - `"Application [title] transitioned from UNDER_TESTED to DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETE by [creator] on [timestamp]."`

### Notifications
- **Publishing Notification:**  
  - "Your Application has been published and is now live in the App Store."
- **Deployment Notification:**  
  - "Application [title] has been successfully deployed to your Space."
- **Monitoring Alerts:**  
  - In-app and email alerts for performance issues or critical feedback.

## Summary
Phase 6, Deployment & Post-Deployment, is the final stage in the Application lifecycle. In this phase, the Creator finalizes and publishes the Application, transitioning it from a testing state to a production-ready state (`PUBLISHED`). Once published, the Application is listed in the company App Store, where Company Admins or SpaceAdmins can deploy it into designated Spaces. Post-deployment, the system monitors performance, gathers user feedback, and logs every action for auditing and compliance. Strict business rules ensure that only fully tested and approved Applications are deployed, and all state transitions, publishing, and deployment actions are transparently recorded and notified. This phase ensures that the Application is not only live but also maintained under continuous oversight.
